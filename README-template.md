## My process

### Built with

-  HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS 


I learned about like use properties rather to follow someone use it according to own comfort and i learned how to approach when design any layout.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media screen and (max-width:480px){
    body{
        background-image: url(./images/pattern-background-mobile.svg);
        font-size: 14px;
    }
    .container{
        max-width: 340px;
    }
    .title{
        font-size: 1.5rem;
    }
    .subtitle{
        font-size: 1rem;
    }
    .plan-box-left{
        font-size: 1rem;
    }
    
}
```


Well i'm beginner in this development era and try to improve My skills using Projects. so it helps me alot to figureout how to use flexbox and grid layout.
